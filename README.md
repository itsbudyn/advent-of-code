# advent-of-code

Welcome to my repository containing source code used to obtain answers to various editions of Advent of Code.
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a programming advent calendar made by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl).

- Fully written in Python (for the time being)
- Tried to stick as close to the standard library as possible (avoided imports if I didn't have to use them)
- All of these have been written by me:
  - No pasted source code (neither parts nor its entirety)
  - No spoiling the solution
  - Absolutley ZERO LLMs used in any capacity (no ChatGPT, Copilot or any other)
  - Only forms of help used: 
    - Looking up how to do something in a programming language (like: generating a 2d array with X and Y dimensions)
    - Searching how to use some library (e.g. re)
    - Algorithm research (looking up how does stuff such as BFS, Dijkstra work)
- I took part in it casually, as more of a test of my programming skills and an opportunity to learn.
### In order not to spoil the solution, this repository will be hidden during any ongoing editions of the Advent of Code in which I'm taking part.
